# void(nullptr)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smnast/void-nullptr
```

## Usage
On a base Void Linux installation (not quite sure at what point yet, maybe before void-install), run `nullptr.sh`\
If on a virtual machine, it might be necessary to run `nullptr.sh --vm`, otherwise the installation script will setup `libvirtd` which may cause some problems with nested virtualization.

## Credits
- This repository will feature a modified version of [appim](https://github.com/fralnz/appim)
